        <p>The complications of diabetes can be devastating. <span class="boldColor">Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)</span> is one of the leading causes of blindness in adults. 438 million people are projected to suffer from diabetes and its complications by 2030. The number of patients with diabetes is roughly doubling every 10 years. DR currently affects over 5.3 million Americans age 18 or older. A study in 2010 stated that more than 27 million Americans are affected by diabetes now, with 67 million estimated to have pre-diabetes.<br /><br />

BetaStem’s technology is derived from discoveries that CD34+ stem cells become activated gaining highly advantageous regenerative properties when treated with a proprietary antisense to block a major activation inhibitor, namely transforming growth factor-beta, (TGF-β1) . The activated stem cells home into the damaged vascular regions of the retina, initiating a process of blood vessel regeneration and thereby preserving eye health.</p><br /><br />

            <summary><span class="boldColor">Patrick Iversen, PhD</span>, (Founding SAB Member)</summary>
            <p>Dr. Iversen’s education began at Westminster College from 1973 – 1976 where he earned a B.S. degree, majoring in Biology and minoring in Physical Sciences.  He then attended the University of Utah from 1979 – 1984, earning his PhD within the Department of Biochemical Pharmacology and Toxicology.  Upon earning his PhD Dr. Iversen performed his post-doctoral research at the Eppley Institute for research in Cancer and Allied Diseases from 1984 – 1987 where his research concentrated on cloning human drug metabolizing genes and evaluating their expression.
            <br><br>
Dr. Iversen’s professional career began in 1976 as a Biology research technician at the University of Utah.  In 1978, he transitioned to the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Utah Medical Center as a Research Technician.  From 1987 – 1998 Dr. Iversen worked as a Professor in the departments of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.  In 1997, Dr. Iversen began his career in the private sector as Senior Vice President of Research and Development at AVI BioPharma, where he worked until 2012 (In March of 2008 AVI BioPharma changed its name to Sarepta). In December 2012, Dr. Iversen returned to higher education as a professor at Oregon State University where he is currently still employed.<br><br>

Dr. Iversen has published 204 peer reviewed publications, 16 book chapters, 245 abstracts and 9 editorials. He has over 74 patent applications and granted patents as well as three PMO Investigational New Drug Applications to the FDA:<br>

            <p>Dr. Grant’s research efforts have been focused on characterizing the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of Diabetic Retinopathy.  Her efforts revolved around understanding the role of growth factors, in particular insulin-like growth factor I, in the pathogenesis of aberrant neovascularization that characterizes proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.  Her team is using a novel in vitro system of cultured human retinal endothelial cells (HREC) from diabetic and nondiabetic donors to characterize cellular interactions with growth factors.  In addition to growth factors, the extracellular matrix (ECM) is an important regulator of endothelial cell behavior.  Increased amounts of aberrant matrix seen in Diabetic Retinopathy may contribute to the endothelial cell dysfunction found in the disease.  Her work has established a role for the protease inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor in regulating ECM accumulation in Diabetic Retinopathy.  She has examined the effect of matrix protein fibronectin (Fn) and fragments of Fn (Fn-f) in modulating stages of angiogenesis.</p>
