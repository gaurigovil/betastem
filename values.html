    	<p>The complications of diabetes can be devastating. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness in adults. 438 million people are projected to suffer from diabetes and its complications by 2030. The number of patients with diabetes is roughly doubling every 10 years. DR currently affects over 5.3 million Americans age 18 or older. A study in 2010 stated that more than 27 million Americans are affected by diabetes now, with 67 million estimated to have pre-diabetes.<br /><br />


BetaStem’s technology is derived from discoveries that CD34+ stem cells become activated gaining highly advantageous regenerative properties when treated with a proprietary antisense to block a major activation inhibitor, namely transforming growth factor-beta, (TGF-β1) . The activated stem cells home into the damaged vascular regions of the retina, initiating a process of blood vessel regeneration and thereby preserving eye health.<br /><br />

BetaStem offers the first real solution for DR by preventing and repairing micro-capillary closure (ischemia). </p>
